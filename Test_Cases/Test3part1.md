# Test Case 

I believe the tests could be automated for this game because you could write a script in Python to mimic the inputs of a human player to determine how many enemies must be defeated to reach the right edge. You could create a targeting system to fire on incoming enemies until the required number is defeated, so that the player object arrives to the right edge. You could set the weapons to fire at set intervals also. 

One change I might suggest to the game creators is that if you miss the target such as being up when you should be down you could move one interval backwards away from the right edge to make it harder to reach the next level. Having the game moving backwards and farwars based on accuracy could help give game variance and keep it challenging.

Two of the requirements I would find helpful for testing would be do all enemies only need one hit to defeat? and do you have to defeat a set number of enemies to advance to next level and if so how many?

## Test Details

* Test Case ID:
  * #1
* Test Case Name:
  * #Number of foes to defeat
* Component: 
  * Testing if the number of foes defeated to advance to the next level is consistant each time the game is played.
* Test Case Designer:
  * Jo Marie Leatherman
* Creation Date:
  * 5/4/2021
* Modified By:
  * None
* Modified Date:
  * None
* Requirements Covered:
  * Behaviorial Testing since the tested knows how the game is expected to act and perform and is doing their tests to see if there is any problems.
* Test Description/Purpose:
  * Play the game at least ten times and make note of how many defeated enemies it takes to reach the right edge. Take note if there are any numbers that do not match up with the expected results given by the developers when asking them about the testing requirements.
* Pre-Test Conditions:
  * Must have game installed on a compatiable device and all needed updates installed for the game and device.
