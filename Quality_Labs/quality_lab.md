# Game 3: Super Smash Brothers Ultimate #

&emsp;In this game you fight against other players or the CPU to gain trophies and other rewards like character unlocks and avatar outfits. The difficulty of the fights can vary depending on the setting chosen before the fight starts and what game mode you play in. With over seventy characters, including download content, you can easily find your favorite fighter and climb up the ranks. Characters are taken from an array of popular Nintendo games as well as others like Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and even even non-combat games like Animal Crossing have made its way into the line-up. Multiple game modes help keep the game engaging and fun including an Adventure mode where you battle foes on a preset map, a training area with courses to help you learn the ropes, and the classic brawl mode to fight one to many foes on a multitude of level courses. To win you have to knock you opponent out or off screen before they do the same to you. Some stages have certain limitations to hinder you if you are not properly prepared. With the Switch you can use Amiibo fighters to save character data and setups and powerup the respective character, but Amiibo is not required to fully enjoy everything the game has to offer.

&emsp;This game is described as a multiplayer fighting game that you can play against local people (same system two controller sets) or over the internet (via online Nintendo membership that requires monthly payments). This follows the **Correctness** Factor, because people are able to choose their character and game mode then combat with or against each other. This game also has the **Reliability** Factor, because you can expect the characters to do certain special attacks based on button presses and setting configuration, such as having one button programmed to be a shield you know your character will shield if you press the button. This game has been ported to multiple game systems such as GameCube, 3DS, and now the Switch, and the base game has not significantly changed over the years besides adding more characters, levels, and rewards. This shows the game's **Efficiency** Factor, because the code didn't have to be reworked from scratch each time a new game came out. In order to play online with other people you have to have an active Nintendo membership (requires monthly fees), but this helps Ninteno maintain **Integry** with its user userbase by making sure the account is linked to a real person. 

&emsp;This game offers a range of difficulty modes from effortless 0.0-0.9 to Nothing Harder! 9.0 enemy power rating. See [Smash Brothers Difficulty SSB4 and Ultimate](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Difficulty) section for more information on how the difficult scales affect the strength and damage of enemy foes while fighting. This ability to tailor your game experience based on how you personally play satisfies the **Usability** Factor. If you encounter any errors while playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, you are advised to contact [Nintendo Support](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/) for troubleshooting help. This helps to enforce **Maintainability** for the game by getting feedback from users and resolving issues that come up as people are playing. Nintendo works along side their staff and userbase to test new and existing content for bugs and to troubleshoot when errors happen satisfying the **Testability** Factor. 

&emsp;With over seventy characters and over one hundred unique selectable levels to play on this game satisfies the **Flexibility** Factor, because each character has their own set of skills and specialities, while the levels offer obstacles and challenges to keep the player thinking on their feet. This game satisfies the **Portability** Factor because it has been reimagined on many of Nintendo's biggest systems including the GameCube, Wii, 3DS, and now the Switch with new characters, levels, and rewards each time it gets a version upgrade. This game is mainly featured on Nintendo products, but I believe it would do well if allowed to be played on systems like the PS4/PS5 or XBOX systems. Playing this game online with others while collecting trophies and achievements would draw in crowds of players from the two big player groups, if Ninteno ever wished to port this game on systems besides their own. If Nintendo did offer the game on other systems it would comply with the **Interoperability** Factor. Nintendo had used the difficulty system from one of its previous games Kid Icarus: Uprising in Super Smash Brothers 4 (Wii) and in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate (Switch) *see [Smash Brothers Difficulty SSB4 and Ultimate](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Difficulty)*, which shows that the game has the **Reusability** Factor.
