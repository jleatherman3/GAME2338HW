Part One: Clone to hard drive (local directory)

In GitHub goto repo and click code then the copy link for clone repo

goto project folder on computer and right click and open in Git Bash

type
git clone <url from git hub>
(no <> when typing. use shift+insert to copy url)

Check folder to make sure everything copied in then continue


Part Two: Upload back to GitHub

Go to project folder 
GitRepos> HWFolder>

Move/add files as needed

Right click HWfolder and select open with Git Bash

Type

git add .
this adds any new changes from local directory to a temp folder to be uploaded

type 

git commit -m "Message goes here"
This will commit the changes made to the selected folder and add the attached message to any changed files


******* Need help from here onwards ********

type

git push --tags
Push changes to GitHub with attached tags for files (didn't work)

git push 
Pushes changes to GitHub as new files without commit history

Need steps to pull commit history from Github and attach it to the local files then push it up to the clone file in the folders.

After commit history is transfered over I can delete the duplicate files from the main repo to clean things up
