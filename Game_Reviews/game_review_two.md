### Rating

On a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (very good) I rate the game features as follows:

*Storytelling:* 3/5 I rated this in the middle because I never played Final Fantasy Tactics before the PSP version and so I was unfamiliar with the story and history of the game. It was unclear what the purpose of the main character was at first, until after you fight the first two battles and learn about the rouge factions trying to overthrow the kingdom your character is fighting along with. After the princess of your character's kingdom gets kidnapped by one of these rogue knights it becomes clearer what your goal is as you set out on a journey to rescue her and defeat your kingdom's enemies. 

*Graphics:* 4/5 I enjoyed the style of the cut scenes quite a bit since it looked almost hand drawn frame by frame which is rarely done now that CGI is used for a majority of the current games. I appreciate the time and effort it takes to hand draw character scenes and animate them. From the first hour I played on a new file I noticed a few laggy spots in the cut scenes and animations, but overall it seemed pretty well done considering the time the game came out.

*Audio/Sound Effects:* 4/5 Music is well selected for the game and I like the voice acting done during cut scenes to add more feeling and emphasis on the situation such as when the princess is kidnapped you can hear some regret in her capture's voice before he takes her that you might miss just reading the words yourself. 

*Fighting System:* 4/5 I don't play tactical type games very often so I can say the first few battles were a bit tough for me to figure out what to do and how to move each character into range for attacks. Certain characters had long distance throwing attacks, while others could only attack if enemy was right next to them. Chemist class was very useful to heal an ally by throwing a potion at them within a set range. From my experience of other Final Fantasy games I'm assuming you can change into more class types as you advance in the game to get better abilities and weapons or improve your overall stats. 

*Magic/Summon System:* 3/5 I had to ask my sister, whom finished this game, about this because at the start of the game you do not have any magic or summons, but later on when you do unlock summon abilities they become very helpful to hit all enemies on the map at the same time. Magic abilities act as long range attacks with a set distance range so you can attack foes further away or even heal an ally that might not be close by. Maybe having some basic magic abilities at the beginning of the game could be useful, but I think it is left for later on so you can learn how to fight without it and understand the battle mechanics better.

*Mini-Games:* 3?/5 I'm not entirely sure what mini-games are offered in Tactics, but I did encounter a recruitment system to help you gain new fighters at the very expensive price of 1400 per unit. The recruit would start at level 1 and have basic equipment setup along with average starting stats for their chosen class. What seemed to change was the bravery and faith numbers which I think are your physical and magic growth depending on how high those are you gain skills faster for either weapon abilities or magic respectively.

*Overall:* 4/5 I played the game for about an hour to get an overall feel of what it was about and what the objective of the game is. I was a little surprised when the game offered me no tutorials on how to fight with any of my units or explain what the different classes could do when the first battles started up. Maybe since it is like a remaster from an older version they assumed you played before and knew the mechanics already, but to access a tutorial you have to pass the first two battles and unlock the world map selection. From world map you press select then you can view tutorial information. This felt a little odd for me after playing so many other games that walked you through battle sequences to make sure you understood how to fight before they send you on that first official mission. Another thing I learned was in certain battles if you knock down an enemy a counter will appear over their head and if they are not revived before the counter reaches 0 they will turn into a treasure box that you can move your character too and claim the item inside. I found this to be a cool mechanic so that you don't rush through battles and you have to plan out your moves so you don't miss important loot when the last enemy is defeated.

## Summary

&emsp;Final Fantasy Tactics is a tactical roleplaying game published by Squaresoft (later changed to Square and then SquareEnix) originally for the PlayStation One console and the Gameboy Advance, but later was ported to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) system with additional content such as multiplayer, full English voice acting during cut scenes, however no Japanese voice acting was available, new items, new job classes, and new wide screen 16:9 support. This game uses Isometric graphic design to allow the battle maps to be rotated and viewed from multiple angles (top down, 3/4 view, 3D rotation) to help determine what the best move for the player is. Sometimes this would allow you to see hidden foes or treasure on the map as you move your fighters around.

&emsp;This game focuses around two main characters Ramza Beoulve a former knight for kingdom of Ivalice fighting as a sell sword of honor and justice, and Delita Heiral, Ramza's childhood friend, also former knight of Ivalice, that turned rouge and joined the kingdom of Ordalia after the Fifty Year's War ended. The Fifty Year's War was a power struggle between three powerful kingdoms Ivalice, Ordalia, and Romanda. It was during this war that the King of Ordalia was killed leaving behind an infant heir unfit to rule. A Regent would be named to rule in place of the child heir until they became of age to assume the throne; however two potential Regents come forth Prince Goltana and Prince Larg starting yet another brutal war known as the War of the Lions. This war would end with massive losses in both factions and ultimately both Prince Goltana and Prince Larg would fall by the hands of the Church whom aim to gain power and control over Ivalice to resurrect their leader Ultima. Ramza's group is tasked with defeating Ultima to save the world and restore peace. 

## Final Thoughts

&emsp;One of the things I liked about the game is that the character classes add things to the character to help them during fights such as giving them long ranged attacks, or better movement so they can move more squares during their turn, or access to healing items/spells. Having different classes helps customize the battle units to what is more suitable for the situation as well as help you unlock skills and abilities of the characters. It gives the game a better range of characters rather than always using one character to steal, heal, or summon. Another thing I liked about the game was the battle map designs giving different elevations and environments (such as water that the character sinks into to look like they are hiding). Having a higher jump stat allows you to get up to higher elevations to possible escape the foe's attack range or even attack from afar if you have magic or a bow. I liked being able to move behind the foe to do extra damage like a sneak attack as well. It helped a lot against enemies that had larger health than my units to even things out. 

&emsp;From the short time I played the thing I didn't enjoy most about the game was they didn't really explain to me about the job classes or their differences in the early battles I fought in so I was confused why some units could move very far while others not so much, and same with attacking too. Some units  had long range attacks, while others did not. I only learned about the class system after the tutorials unlocked and I was able to read about squires, knights, and chemists then I started to understand my units better. I guess this is a complaint for all Final Fantasy games, but phoenix downs are way too expensive early game. I had one of my units die, but I didn't have enough money to buy any phoenix downs so unfortunately she left my party for good and I could not recruit her back unless I restarted from my last save and redid the battle sequence. I always expect to lose in combat early game quite a few times while I'm getting familiar with the mechanics, but to not have the gold to buy revives as a backup is a bit disheartening. This game you have to take the battles seriously and manage all your units carefully to keep the healthy and out of harmâ€™s way so you don't lose them.
