### Rating

On a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (very good) I rate the game features as follows:

*Storytelling:* 4/5 Story is engaging and interesting to follow. It has plenty of surpise elements to keep the plot moving and help identify the next player objective. As you progress in the game you learn more about each of the main characters and what motivates them to continue their journey together. Eventually the characters learn that the Trine is a powerful magical artifact which summoned them all together to carry out specific tasks and missions. 

*Graphics:* 4/5 The graphic style of this game is beautifly designed and reminds me of older computer rpg type games where you make a character to go fight monster hoards eventually beating a super boss at the end. Powerups are shown as brightly colored orbs or potions so they are easy to spot while traveling around and fighting things. Animations seen fluid and respond well for both movement and attacks.

*Audio/Sound Effects:* 4/5 Backgound music for this game is very vibrant and helps set the pace of scenes such as boss fights or tense story moments. Sound effects are well placed and chosen to add effect to their attached elements like exlosing artows or bridges breaking from traps. Sometimes dialogue is a bit hard to hear so I play with subtitles on.

*Fighting System:* 4/5  Main fighting role is assigned to the knight character who acts like a tank with the best defense and offense, but he has slower movement. The thief can assist by shooting arrows, but with less denfense and health she is easier to kill. The mage character can help by drawing boxes or planks then dropping or ramming them into foes, but with the lowest health and defense overall the mage is easiest to kill. Using these characters strengths while being aware of their weakness will help turn the battle in your favor.

*Magic/Summon System:* 3/5 The magic system for the mage character uses the touchpad or right thumbstrick+L2 buttons to draw specific shapes which become magical objects in the game such as a box to climb on or a plank to act as a brige across a gap. As you level the mage's abilities you gain access to more objects you can draw and can have those objects become magnetic for the theif to grapple onto and swing from. The thief gains the ability to turn invisabile for a short time as her magic ability grows allowing her to sneak past foes and traps unnoticed. The theif also gains magic arrows such as exploding, freezing, and gravity control. The knight gains the ability to have a fire sword which can be used to do higher damage to foes. Sometimes the aim system for the theif to shoot can be laggy causing you to miss or shoot short. For the mage the drawing size of the objects is not always consistant so it can make solving puzzles difficult.

*Mini-Games:* 3/5 The puzzles in this game can be hard to figure out sometimes, but I've noticed with at least one other person helping you are able to find ways to solve challenges by working together such as the mage drawing a box then the thief grapples on to it to move across a gap. For both players to cross they would have to switch characters and reverse the process with the second player drawing the box and the first using it to grapple over the ledge with their partner. You can still clear these puzzles in single player mode but often times have to switch characters quickly and make percise jumps to finish them. 

*Overall:* 4/5 The puzzles in this game are challenging and require you to switch between the three main characters to acomplish them and move forward. Having the option to play with others locally or online allows for additional players to take on the role of whichever character(s) are not selected by player one. You can also swap roles at any time as needed so you are not stuck playing one role all the time. Collecting experience items hidden in the levels allows you to unlock hidden abilities of the main characters to solve puzzles and fight easier. Some of the puzzles are hard to solve and there is no hint system in place to help so I had to refer to video guides when I was stuck on something.

## Summary

&emsp;Amadeus is the mage character and he is able to bring objects into the environment when the player draws shapes on the screen with the touchpad or right thumbstick. The object created can be used in various ways to provide ledges to move forward or fight foes. His abilities can be upgraded so his objects are magentic and can be grappled onto with the thief or moved by the knight. Zoya is the thief character and she is able to grapple onto wood surfaces then swing to ledges. She can also fire arrows to fight foes and when you upgrade her abilities you can fire explodingg arrows, freezing arrows, and gravity control arrows. She is also able to turn invisiable for a short time to sneak past foes and traps. Pontius is the knight character and he is able to use a shild to block attacks and projectile traps. He also has a sword to fight with that can be upgraded to use fire and deal more damage. You can also upgrade his shield to allow you to jump off a ledge and glide down to an area below. He can also move metal objects with his shield when it is upgraded.

&emsp;These characters are brought together by a magical object known as the Trine that speaks to them and sends them on a harrowing journey to destroy the evil in the world and restore balance. As the story progresses the Trine reveals more to the story to the player and explains their next objective. The Trine becomes a guiding force for the group to help them in the right direction. The group faces hoards of goblins, skeletons and evil possessed creatures as they continue onwards towards the cause of the corruption in the world. In the beginning each of the characters had their own objectives such as the knight procting his kingdom while the thief wanted to plunder it, but the Trine brought them together to work as a team to save the world.
