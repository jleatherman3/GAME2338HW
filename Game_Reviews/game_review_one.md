### Rating

On a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (very good) I rate the game features as follows:

*Storytelling:* 5/5 The plot of the game is engading and keeps the player guessing what will happen next.

*Graphics:* 4/5 For the time this came out the backgrounds and models look pretty good. Some monster models are reused and changed slightly making fights feel a bit redundant in later areas.

*Audio/Sound Effects:* 5/5 Music for this game helps set the mood for fights and key scenes. Sound Effects, especially the voice acting of the fighting moves, make this game memoriable.

*Fighting System:* 5/5 Uses a series of button inputs from the player controller to carry out combo moves and special abilities known as "Arts." Defending/guarding can increase the amount of button inputs you can do next turn.

*Magic/Summon System (Seru Abilities):* 3/5 This system is rated lower because you have to kill specific monsters and then absorb them (with a set and sometimes very low capture chance) to gain their abilities. Once absorbed you can use abilities at the cost of MP (magic points stat) and the abilities gradually level over time. It takes quite a lot of uses for the abilities
to reach their max potential. Even with an accessory called Ivory Book (increases capture chance 20%) some monsters are very hard to absorb such as Guillem with a 1% chance (unaffected by the book).

*Mini-Games:* 4/5 There is a bunch of fun mini games available in this game including fishing, slots, and fighting past bosses.
Playing the mini games can be fun, but most require a lot of repetition to get good rewards which is why I rated this a bit lower.

*Overall:* 4/5 This game is still one of my favorites and I enjoy playing it from time to time even in the current day. 
I hope it will be on digital download someday so more people can experience it. 

## Summary

&emsp;This game focuses around three heros Vahn, Noah, and Gala who come together to fight an evil force generating "mist" that summons ferocious monsters. The mist engulfs villages bringing forth the monsters called "seru'' who attack the townpeoples and destroy the village structures in their rampaging state. The only way to drive back the mist is to awaken Genesis Trees with prays of hope and courage. These special trees hold within them the powers of a special type of guardian monster called a Raseru that joins with the heros to help them fight. The Raseru are able to absorb the abilities of defeated foes and use their powers. The Raseru also act as a guiding force to the heros helping them travel from place to place in search of Genesis trees to awaken and monsters to defeat. 

&emsp;The first chapter of the game you play as Vahn and are able to meet the people of his village and learn some backstory about the mist and the people controlling it. Everything seems peaceful at first until a giant monster invades the village breaking down the wall holding the mist back. As the mist and monsters start flooding into the village Vahn has to learn how to fight and defend himself and others. After learning the beginning battle mechanics you have to fight your way though the chaotic village rescuing villagers from monsters as you make your way to the town square where the dormant Genesis Tree is starting to glow. The village chief tells you about the Genesis Tree and how it has the power to drive away the mist if only it could be awakened. The villagers come together with Vahn to pray that the Genesis Tree will awaken and save them all. Their prayers are heard and answered by a Raseru inside the Genesis Tree who awakens it and pushes away the mist from the village. Afterwards the Raseru joins with Vahn and he is given the mission to go throughout the world seeking more dormant Genesis Trees to awaken saving villages from the mist with his friends he meets as he travels Noah and Gala. Eventually the trio goes forth to fight the ones causing the mist to appear so they can save the entire world of Legaia.

## Final Thoughts

&emsp;I really enjoyed the fighting system of this game that reminded me of Tekken and Mortal Kombat where you input a series of buttons for a powerful move. The characters would have voice acting parts for their special attacks including the major boss characters. It was fun to try out different combos and see if it unlocked a hidden technique. You also had a list of techniques you did before in the game for quick reference so you can use them again. Another part I liked from the game was being able to use healing magic (after absorbing the right monsters) so it helped a lot in boss fights if you didn't have equivalent items available to you. I also enjoyed the story of the game and how it guided you along the way so you knew where to go and what your next objective is. You had a clear sense of who the villains are and what the end goal was to drive away the mist from the entire world and save everyone from the evil monsters. One of the things I didn't like was the low capture rates on some of the monsters making it difficult to obtain their abilities. You also had to capture the monsters separately on each of the three heros making the process that much longer and tedious. Higher level monsters did have a slightly better capture rate, but still it was a struggle. Another thing I didn't like was the amount of repetitions needed in mini games to get the best prizes such as the fighting arena had to be repeated twenty times or more to get powerful accessories.
