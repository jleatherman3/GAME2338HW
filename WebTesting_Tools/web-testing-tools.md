# Web Testing Tools

## Tool One

_What is the name of the test tool?_ 

[Kobiton](https://kobiton.com)

_What company developed this test tool?_ 

[Kobiton Inc.](https://kobiton.com/about/)

_Does this tool do any test case storage/recording?_ 

Yes the information from the tests being run is stored within the administor account, such as screenshots and test history, until it is deleted by the account owner, or if the account is canceled. [FAQ - Data Stored on servers](https://docs.kobiton.com/faq/general-questions/#do-you-store-my-app-tests-and-other-files-on-your-servers-for-how-long)

_Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?_ 

I'm not sure on this, but I found in the Q&A section it mentions going into the execution list and then opening up revisit session to look for failures. I don't see anything about linking those failures to issue numbers like Git has though. [Q&A Page](https://docs.kobiton.com/ita/q&a/)

_If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?_ 

It seems to have a webview portal that works with HTML to allow testing via the web. [Webview infomation](https://docs.kobiton.com/faq/general-questions/#my-app-is-hybrid-and-always-times-out-when-finding-elements-on-kobiton-devices-what-should-i-do)
